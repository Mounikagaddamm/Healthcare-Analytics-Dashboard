# Healthcare Waitlist Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital patient waitlist data using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dataset,  contains anonymized records of patient cases segmented by type, specialty, age profile, and time bands. The objective is to uncover bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the patient admission process and support data-driven decisions in hospital operations.

## 🎯 Goals
- Monitor hospital waitlist trends
- Identify high-delay areas by specialty and patient group
- Enable data-driven planning for resource allocation
- Improve transparency for operational decision-makers

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
 Metric                      Value / Insight                             

 Total Waitlist Patients    542,000+                                     
 Average Wait Time          80.65 Days                                   
 Specialty-Level Insights   E.g., Paed Cardiology: 255.48 Days Avg Wait 
 Age Profile Segments       0–15, 16–64, 65+                             
 Case Types                 Inpatient, Day Case                          
 Time Band Segmentation     0–3, 3–6, 6–9, 9–12+ months                  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Dashboard design and data visualization
- **DAX** – Calculated measures and KPI logic
- **Excel** – Data preprocessing and cleaning

## 📁 Dataset Description 
The dataset includes:
- ArchiveDate: Date of record
- CaseType: Type of patient case (Inpatient/Day Case)
- AgeProfile: Patient age group
- SpecialtyName: Medical specialty
- TimeBand: Time delay category (e.g., 0–3 months)
- WaitTime (Days): Numeric field for average wait duration

All personally identifiable information (PII) has been removed to maintain data privacy.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- The majority of waitlist backlog falls in the 3–6 month band
- Pediatric specialties such as Paed Cardiology experience the longest delays
- Day Cases are typically resolved faster than Inpatient cases
- Age groups 65+ tend to have longer wait durations across most specialties

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time scheduling APIs for live monitoring
- Add drill-through reports per region or hospital
- Apply ML models to forecast capacity needs
